    *** Knowing About reconcilation - why and where react uses it

    in whattodo.txt you have written alot of logic and a lot of codes----Frames like view and react 
    came to hide the complexity....What if we dont have to worry about the append child , create child....

    What if we have just one variable and we just have to work for the calling


  Reconcilation- It is the process of react or view for taking the update and translating  it to the dom by calling append child and create child

  ---Lets create a reconciler of our own

  function createDomElements(data){
         var parentElement = document.getElementById("mainArea");
        parentElement.innerHTML = ""; // ✅ Clear old content before adding new ones

        for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
          var childElement = document.createElement("div");
          childElement.id = data[i].id; // ✅ Set ID directly without "todo-"

          var grandChildElement1 = document.createElement("span");
          grandChildElement1.innerHTML = data[i].title + " ";

          var grandChildElement2 = document.createElement("span");
          grandChildElement2.innerHTML = data[i].description + " ";

          var grandChildElement3 = document.createElement("button");
          grandChildElement3.innerHTML = "Delete";
          grandChildElement3.setAttribute(
            "onclick",
            "deleteTodo(" + data[i].id + ")"
          );

          childElement.appendChild(grandChildElement1);
          childElement.appendChild(grandChildElement2);
          childElement.appendChild(grandChildElement3);

          parentElement.appendChild(childElement);
        }
  }

  createDomElements([{
   title:"go to gym",
   description:"go gym daily"

  }])

  /// the above function will craete the values....

    ----in the simar way react has alot of functions in which it have alot of append child , remove child...whatever
    and you give the react the state  and it handles , how to handle what to handle...
    What was the existing state , and what to and how to move from current state to existing state is called reconcilation.



    Now if you call the function again and again remove all the elements then insert all...that is not a optimised way to do it
    Now react does for you it checks the difference between the previous state and current state and updates the UI

    beacuse of react , you wont see everything go away and coming , you will only see one item getting go away




    Assignment---- Write a reconciler of your own which can handle all the state transitions like update , delete add...
                   based on the ids figure out the difference between 2 arrays(before and after ), figure out what rows to be eleiminated updated 
                   and only call the right set of update child , append child .....
                   Reconciler is kind of a transition to the new state.
                   Virtual DOM is what react uses and reconcilatoin is the process by which it replaces the data

   -----The above is kind of react Librabry like react.
