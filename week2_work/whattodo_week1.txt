1. npm init -y   {to create package .json }
2. Create a index.js file
3. Now http server is basically just a protocol, where people have
   already written libraries which you have to use.
   npm = node package manager

4. node index.js  // will run the index.js file

5. const express = require("express")
   npm install express (to bring the library to your machine)
   Express = lets you create http servers

6. you can change the routes in the app.get('/handlesum')

7. Here you can also pass the counter as 
  http://localhost:3000/handlesum?counter=1000&countercounter=2
  here query param is sent after ?, and 2 varibles in clunter
   







// Diffrent libraries
1. to read and write in a file
  const fs = require("fs"); // external library to read and write a file
  function callbackfn(err,data){

  }
fs.readFile("a.txt", "utf-8", callbackfn);
fs.writeFile("initialfiledata.txt", newdata,callbackfn);
// you can use callback function as an arrow function as well

2. Method - 1(to write it from scratch)
    To make a server through Express

    const express = require('express')
    const app = express()
    const port = 3000

    app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello World!')
    })

    app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`)
    })


Method - 2 (go to expressjs.com)
    copy and paste it directly
